# Project overview
In this notebook, you will find our data sourcing, cleaning, manipulation and modeling experiments with this asteroid data. The data comes from the NASA Small Body Database (SBDB) API. Our goal was to predict if an asteroid would be considered a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA), defined as a small body that approaches within 0.05 astronomical units of Earth and has an absolute magnitude, or luminosity, of 22 or brighter. We used the closest distance to Earth as the target variable, and the other features like diameter, velocity, uncertainty in the time of close approach, and others as the independent variables our models were trained on to find any patterns in the data.

# Modules
We used a number of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning approaches to tackle this problem. Some of the libraries we incorporated were:
-KNearest Neighbor
-Logistic Regression
-Support Vector Classifier
-PCA
-TensorFlow
-PyTorch

# Model Results
Here are some examples of the results generated from the models:
